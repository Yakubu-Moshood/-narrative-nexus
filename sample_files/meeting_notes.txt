AGENDA ITEMS:

1. PREMIUM SEGMENT FOCUS (45 minutes)

CEO: "Team, I want to make it clear - our future is in the Premium segment. Premium customers are our most valuable assets. We need to double down on Premium."

Sales Director: "Absolutely. Premium is where the real money is. Our Premium customers have the highest lifetime value. We should focus all our energy there."

CFO: "Premium margins are excellent - 45% gross margin compared to Budget's 25%. Premium is definitely the way to go."

Marketing Manager: "I agree. Premium is the future. Our brand positioning should be Premium-focused. Premium is what separates us from competitors."

CEO: "Exactly. Premium is our competitive advantage. We need to invest more in Premium marketing, Premium customer support, and Premium product development."

Operations Lead: "Premium is also easier to manage operationally. Premium customers are less demanding. Premium is the right choice."

2. BUDGET SEGMENT CONCERNS (15 minutes)

Sales Director: "The Budget segment is becoming a distraction. It's taking up too much of our resources for minimal returns. We should reduce our Budget focus."

CEO: "I agree. Budget is noise. We're wasting time on Budget customers. Let's cut Budget by 30% and reallocate those resources to Premium."

CFO: "Budget is dragging down our margins. If we eliminate Budget, our overall margins improve significantly. Budget is not worth the effort."

Marketing Manager: "Budget marketing is ineffective. Premium marketing gets better ROI. We should stop Budget campaigns entirely."

Operations Lead: "Budget operations are complex. Cutting Budget would simplify our operations. Budget is a burden."
